1. Program to print frequency of character in sorted order
2. Initialize String
3. Substring index example.
4. Check string is palindrome or not
5. Check if string is subsequence of other I/P - s1 = ABCD s2= AD O/P - true , I/P - s1 = ABCDE s2= AED O/P - false
6. Program to check anagram
7. Given a string, the task is to find the first character (whose leftmost appearance is first) that repeats.
8. Check if result string is valid shuffle of string first and second
9. Reverse string
10. Print Duplicate
11. Check Strings are rotations of each other
12. Index of leftmost non-repeating element
13. Reversing words in the string
14. Count and Say Problem
15. Longest Palindromic Subsequence and Length of Longest Palindromic Subsequence
16. Function to find the longest repeating subsequence
17. Print subsequence string
18. Program to print all permutations of a given string
Pattern Searching
-----------------
19. Given a pattern and a text, we need to print all occurrences of the pattern in the text - O((m+n-1)*m) solution.
20. Given a pattern with distinct characters and a text, we need to print all occurrences of the pattern in the text - improved Naive pattern searching with Theta(n) time complexity
21. Rabin Karp Algorithm - 0((N-M+1)*M)
22. KMP - Part1
23. KMP - Part2
24. Check if Strings are Rotations
25. Given a text and a pattern, the task is to find if there is anagram of pattern present in text - two solutions to solve the problem.
